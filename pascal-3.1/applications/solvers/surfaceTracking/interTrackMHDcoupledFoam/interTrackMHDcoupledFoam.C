Description

TODO [High]: Where does the very high (time-linear) volume conservation error come from if the Alberto-method is NOT used?

TODO [High]: Why is the Alberto-method much less stable in icf-small or for strong deformations - boundary correction?

TODO [High]: What about curvature at wall contact line? It seems that the contact angle is always 90Â°

TODO [High]: Why does tangential surface tension lead to instable calculations?

TODO [High]: What about tangential surface tension at wall contact line and with presence of FL

TODO [High]: What happens on wedge meshes and tetFemMotionSolver?

TODO [High]: What happens on annulus wedge meshes (with symmetry at annulus inner side) and pseudoSolid tetFemMotionSolver?

TODO [Low]: Add a description
